# Nightly encrypted off-box backup of everything that cannot be rebuilt:
# the Postgres database and the CV files on the data mount.
#
# Verified end to end on throwaway containers by scripts/backup/drill.sh
# (dump -> restic -> restore -> row counts and CV decryption; CI runs it
# in .github/workflows/backup-drill.yml). Not yet proven against the
# production remote: an operator still has to run docs/BACKUPS.md Step 6
# there, because a backup nobody has restored is a hope, not a backup.
#
# Environment (set in .env, consumed via docker-compose.prod.yml):
#   RESTIC_REPOSITORY        where snapshots go (s3:/b2:/sftp:/rest:)
#   RESTIC_PASSWORD          encryption key — LOSING IT LOSES THE BACKUPS
#   PGHOST/PGUSER/PGDATABASE/PGPASSWORD
#   BACKUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS  default 86400
#   BACKUP_KEEP_DAILY        default 30
#   BACKUP_HEALTHCHECK_URL   optional: pinged on success (dead-man switch)
#   BACKUP_ONCE              1 = run a single cycle and exit with its status
#                            (first run by hand, the drill)
